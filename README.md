# Bootstrap Assignment

This project is centered around a principle known as Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.

For this project I was tasked with the following assignments:

Start your page by using the bootstrap 4 boilerplate template.
Modify it to include the following: – A container – Jumbotron with overwritten CSS for its background color. – Mixed mobile and desktop grid system to create a dynamic and flexible layout. – Top Navigation (customize color and link text) – One CTA button – Add two images to your page. – H1, H2, H3 tags – Display class – Text
Upon completing this assignment I have a thorough understanding of what a Bootstrap framework is, how it is used, and how it can improve my working environment and time to completion.
