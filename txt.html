        <h1>The Natural Healing Power of Crystals</h1>
        <p>The reason most never have the opportunity to appreciate the Earth we live on, is because most never take the
            time to learn about the healing properties of the planet. The Earth is made up of a vast array of minerals,
            crystals, and other natural elements. When the Earth came into existence, everything humans needed in order
            to survive was abundantly present. In the current day in age, we are running low on resources, and it is
            because we are not properly educated as a people around the way to maintain an already self-sustaining
            planet. </p>
